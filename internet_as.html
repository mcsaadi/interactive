<h1>The Internet as a Child</h1>

<h2>The internet is born.</h2> 
<p>In the very beginning, the basic cognitive blueprint is there, but with not much input to work with.</p>
<br>

<h2>The internet as a toddler.</h2> 
<p>Vast amounts of new input start rolling in. There is very little uniformity as to how that input is arranged or filtered, and things can get very overwhelming and confusing. On the other hand, things are as exciting as ever.</p>
<br>

<h2>The internet as a teenager.</h2>
<p>There is still a lot of input/data out there, and the overwhelming nature of it becomes more scary than fun. For once there are active efforts to get it arranged — predictably giving rise to some existential crises.</p>
<br>

<h2>The internet as a young adult.</h2> 
<p>After some experimentation during adolescence, it’s a bit clearer which data will stick around and which data will go (although it’ll never be fully gone, just hidden in some pockets of memory). The small pieces that stuck around get arranged into larger structures, which facilitates processing but also creates a mesh void of the initial exciting miscellaneousness.</p>
<br>

<h2>The internet as an adult.</h2> 
<p>Things might have turned out different, but given the input so far and the timing of it, this is how things have turned out to be and we have to work with what we have. We get introduced to some new unpredicted collateral effects, such as new ethical and moral questions. There’s a lot of superfluous data around, some that just takes up space and that we wish we could erase, some that got lost in the mesh and that we wish we could revisit.</p>
<br>

<h2>The internet in its mid life crisis.</h2>
<p>The mechanisms we created to arrange data and facilitate processing did make things easier, but perhaps too easy, too monotonous, too self-referential. We try to break out of it, trying to open our eyes back to the naive, but its hard. We’ve tied ourselves to too many institutions and breaking free is not easy.</p>
